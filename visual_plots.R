# _ 1.5 Takeaways ####
# There is a correlation throughout all of the different parts in a setup. 
# As described above there are two groups of attributes, correlation with each other:
# - Weight and Speed
# - Acceleration, Mini Turbo, Traction, Handling

# Attributes within a group increase together, whereas attributes from different groups do not (if one increases, the other group decreases)
# This means, that you can pick two different types of characters: Heavy and Fast or Small with good Handling

# Scatter f√ºr unterschiedliche Kombinationen
# Testen eines multiplen Korrelations diagramm


# 2. Correlation Matrix ####
# Using the function ggpairs() to create a correlatio Matrix of the 6 Attributes available
GGally::ggpairs(cross_df_archetype, columns = 5:10)

# As the visual shows are all of the correlation significant.
# The strongest positive cor. are:
# - Weight x Speed (+0.89)
# - Acceleration x Mini Turbo (+0.822)

# The strongest negative cor. are:
# - Speed x Acceleration (-0.802)
# - Handling x Weight (-0.772)

# This information gives proof to the ideas of archetypes above

# 3. Visualizing Scores ####
# This visualization wants to show how the 1700 combinations are spread across the two archetypes.
# It shows, that more combinations are leaning towards the heavy and fast type, 
#  this could be due to the 3 heavy charactersgroups existing (in contrary to only two small charactergroups)

# Histogram for all scores

# 4. Further Analysis ####

# Inside of the data_load_clean.R a user could change the scoring to his personal preferences. 
# The DF could get them give him the best setup for his preferences, which can then be found on our -1 to 1 scale. 
# Different testings resulted in various results. This method would lean towards one of the archetypes but would not give the most extreme values. 

# Function that gives a DF with the 3 best Scores

# 5. What's next? ####

# Another idea would be to test all of these setups in real races. 
# Then the player himself/herself could change the scoring based on his experiences.
# With that, a player could slowly iterate towards his "perfect" Setup. 
# However, no "one best setup" could be identified, rather a knowledge of the archetypes can be given.
